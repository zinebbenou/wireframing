# Wireframing in Software Design

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is a foundational step in the design process where a skeletal framework of a website or application is created. It's a low-fidelity representation that outlines the basic structure, layout, and functionality of a digital interface before any visual design or content is added.

## Importance in Design Process
- **Early Visualization**: Helps translate abstract ideas into tangible representations
- **Efficient Communication**: Facilitates better understanding between stakeholders, designers, and developers
- **Cost-Effective**: Allows for easy modifications before investing in detailed designs
- **User-Focused**: Enables early identification of usability issues and interface improvements
- **Time-Saving**: Streamlines the design process by establishing clear structural guidelines
